This github page has working code for models proposed in my Master's thesis. Link for the thesis will be updated once it's published.

The ember folder has been directly copied from https://github.com/endgameinc/ember. Please refer to the licensing terms on their github page. The code in all these files is not entirely complete. Please let me know if you wish to use any of this code and I will be glad to help you!

Unfortunately, the trained neural networks could not be uploaded here due to file size constrains. You will have to generate them manually.
